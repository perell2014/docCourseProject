## Introduction

Displaying the Mortality in Barcelona using an Excel dataset containing data from Mortality in Barcelona from years 2001 to 2011  (6589 rows), perform a visualization of data from two perspectives: 

1. Evolution of mortality in Barcelona showing all years, according to District and Sex values selected in the sidebar panel combo boxes.
2. Mortality in Barcelona per Cause of death, according to Year, District and Sex selected values in the sidebar panel combo boxes.
3. Calculate and visualize the of mean Comparative Mortality Ratio for each Cause of Death:
